# Part 1: Website Description

**Pod for Business** focuses on delivering value to event-hosting businesses by offering tools to help anticipate attendance. This planning capability empowers businesses to prepare adequately, ensuring they have the necessary resources (like food, drinks, and seating) to provide each attendee with a cohesive, special experience.

**Pod for Business** is designed to support businesses in managing events effectively, focusing on delivering relevant insights while respecting user privacy. No specific user data, such as gender or individual matches, will be shown. Instead, the system highlights key metrics, such as the number of attendees who scanned a QR code, giving businesses a clear view of the event’s impact and the value Pod provides. Additionally, it will display attendance trends across different weeks and months, helping businesses evaluate event success and public perception more accurately. This can help businesses plan discounts, special deals, etc., on days that might generally be less busy.

This platform aims to create significant value for event-hosting businesses by also offering planning tools to help anticipate attendance. With these tools, businesses can better prepare for upcoming events, ensuring they have the necessary resources to accommodate expected attendees, such as food, drinks, seating, etc., to ensure a cohesive and special experience for each person, leading to better ratings.

The flow prioritizes a simple event creation process first. This emphasis on ease of setup ensures that businesses can create events quickly and efficiently, allowing them to focus on what matters most without losing valuable time.

This problem is important to me, as I want to help small businesses engage with the community and help them stand out from other businesses. I also think it’s time to phase out the current trend of online dating, which is manipulative and leads to seeing people as transactional rather than special.

---

## Feedback Summary

The main feedback I received for Pod for Business is on the **data privacy** side, which I think is essential to address clearly. I will not have data visualizations based on any specific user data. Instead, the focus will be on how many people show up and scan the Pod QR code. Other data points mentioned included needing to consider how the data will be visualized. I plan to keep it relatively simple at first, perhaps using a line chart showing the number of people at an event on a given day. This will enable businesses to make informed decisions, like planning discounts on less busy days.

Feedback on my portfolio centered on **interaction considerations**. Many noted that excessive interactions could distract from the showcased work, so I’ll likely keep this project straightforward, as my portfolio design is simple and should remain that way.

Regarding the **Kanban board**, some feedback suggested it felt dull and could be differentiated more. I aim to incorporate data labeling and possibly drag-and-drop features, potentially adding these elements to the Pod dashboard.

---

## Feedback Digestion

The main critique that I plan to act on is the focus on data privacy and clear communication regarding any data collected. Since the app is not focused on collecting personal data, its revenue model would rely on business partnerships and premium subscriptions rather than ads. 

I will focus on the Pod for Business idea as it is the most relevant project for my portfolio. I have already developed a project that could include a business dashboard, which would lead to a cohesive design solution that leverages desktop design, tablet and mobile designs, and various web and mobile app technologies. It is also something I expect to continue working on in the future, increasing my motivation to go above and beyond.

Balancing the scope to meet requirements without expanding too much is essential in creating this web app, especially given other coursework. I want to provide significant value to the end user while maintaining project feasibility.

Taking the feedback seriously regarding **clarity** on what Pod for Business aims to achieve is critical. For business pitches, the value proposition and prototypes must be clearly outlined to showcase how Pod for Business helps local businesses compete with larger entities with more resources for engagement.
