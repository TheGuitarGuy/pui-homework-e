Part 1: Website Description
Pod for Business is designed to support businesses in managing events effectively, focusing on delivering relevant insights while respecting user privacy. No specific user data such as gender or individual matches will be shown. Instead, the system highlights key metrics, such as the number of attendees who scanned a QR code, giving businesses a clear view of the event’s impact and the value Pod provides. Additionally, it will display attendance trends across different weeks and months, helping businesses evaluate event success and public perception more accurately. This can help businesses plan discounts, special deals, etc. on days that might generally be less busy otherwise
This platform aims to create significant value for event-hosting businesses by also offering planning tools to help anticipate attendance. With these tools, businesses can better prepare for upcoming events, ensuring they have the necessary resources to accommodate expected attendees such as food, drinks, seating, etc. to ensure a cohesive and special experience for each person leading to better ratings. 
The flow prioritizes a simple event creation process first. This emphasis on ease of setup ensures that businesses can create events quickly and efficiently, allowing them to focus on what matters most without losing valuable time. 
This problem is important to me as I want to help small businesses engage with the community and help them stand out from other businesses. I also think it’s time to phase out the current trend of online dating that is manipulative and leads to seeing people as transactional rather than special. 

Feedback Summary: 
The main feedback I received for Pod for Business is on the data privacy side of things which I think is important to discuss clearly. I will not have data visualizations that are based on any specific user data. It will only be focused on how many people show up and scan the Pod QR code. Other data points that were mentioned also include needing to consider how the data will be visualized. I think I will keep it relatively simple to start out with. Perhaps a line chart that shows the number of people at an event on a given day for example so that businesses can make more informed decisions surrounding discounts for example. 
The main feedback for the portfolio is considering what interactions I’d add to the portfolio. I think having too many interactions can distract from the work that I am showcasing, so I’ll probably not do this project as my portfolio is simple and should probably remain that way. 
I received actionable feedback for the Kanban board as it seems that people generally feel they are boring and mine could be differentiated. I think I want to take some of this data labeling and perhaps drag and drop technology and perhaps utilize it in my Pod dashboard a bit. 

Feedback Digestion:
The main critique that I will act on is the focus on data privacy and clear communication of any data that may be collected in any way. The app is not focused on collecting data as the revenue model would be supported by businesses and premium subscriptions and not by ads for example. I will focus on the Pod for Business idea as it is the most relevant project for my portfolio as I have already created a project that could have a business dashboard which could lead to a cohesive design solution that leverages desktop design vs tablet design vs mobile design, web vs mobile app design and a number of different interesting technologies. It is also something that I realistically expect to continue in the future which leads to more motivation to go above and beyond with this. 
I think ensuring that the scope meets the requirements but does not become too big is an important aspect of how I go about creating this web app as I want to ensure that it is balanced with other coursework while also proviiding significant value to the end user. 
I think it is important that I take the confused feedback about what this is exactly for to heart as pitching to businesses will require a clear value proposition and clear prototypes that are clear in how they add value for each business involved and how they can be a customer engagement engine to help local businesses compete with larger businesses that have more resources for engagement.
